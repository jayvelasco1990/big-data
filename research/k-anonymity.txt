who, when and where was proposed k-anonymity
what is k-anonymity
why is k-anonymity needed
how does it work
shortcomings and limitations


Categories
Privacy
— L-Diversity
— K-Anonymity
- Distinguishing Factor

Severity
- M-Score
- L-Severity

Privacy is different from severity

impact on lives vs impact on organization vs impact on x

substitute dependency factor for k-anonymity

determine if the leaked table satisfies k-anonymous 

Categorizing the type of leakage - * another factor

Frequency - * another factor

per record vs dimensions [overall privacy, frequency, cause of leakage] - provide index for each type
f(x) * []

time of attack from detection

obtaining severity index of sensitive attributes will vary

Severity based on linkages


Quasi identifiers should be quantified as well




5 reasons why severity quantification is important

1. Regulations - ENISA
The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) handles security  throughout the european union (EU)
Guidelines and procedures to protect against data breaches
Prepare
Detect
Notify
Response
A demand for accuracy on the impact of handling data on the users’ personal lives
Defines what would require and exempt user consent for publication of data
Anonymizes data
Impact on the lives of users
Reason for publication
Opt-out options
States specific purpose
No personal/sensitive 

2. Trend - .5% of all data is analyzed, getting smaller as data grows
Big data saves money and increases efficiency
Changing landscape
Increase investments in modern data warehouse technologies
utilize operational data and big data analytics
includes real time analytics

3. Many Variables
a. Criticality of data [l-severity]
b. How easily data can be identified [not emphasized]
c. How breach occurred [no index/included in quantification]
d. Industry specific metrics

severity increase is positive relationship with breaking k-anonymity

who: organizations, users
what: data breach
when: leaked data
where: can be in multiple places, linked data
why: see above
how: quantification

Experiment - implement in application layer, provide multiple sources
